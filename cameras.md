The hackings of the HERO bus works on:
* HERO 1080 (Aka "Original HERO", "HERO1")
* HERO2
* HERO3 White
* HERO3 Black
* HERO3+ Black

###Silver?

The HERO bus structure of the HERO3 Silver and HERO3+ Silver cameras is different to the HERO bus of her sisters.

Maybe the Silver camera will support a BacPac that any other GoPro camera doesnt.

Or it will not support a BacPac that the other cameras do.
